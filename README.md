# colorpiq
A PySimpleGUI color picker window extension module.

Colorpiq gives you an object oriented, customizable window that agrees with your theme and won't show up at the upper left of your screen.

It uses PySimpleGUI itself for its GUI, so you cab use it with the freedom of any other PySimpleGUI window.
